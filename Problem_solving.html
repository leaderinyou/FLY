                    <h4>What is meant by Problem Solving?</h4>
                    <p>Problem solving is the act of defining a problem; determining the cause 
                        of the problem; identifying, prioritizing, and selecting alternatives for a 
                        solution; and implementing a solution.</p>
                    <h4>Leader must have a great problem solving skills in order to be a great and 
                        inspiring leader.</h4>

                <h2>What is Problem Solving is all about?</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Problem solving</strong> is all about identify the real problem – not the symptom. 
                </p>

                <h2>But then might be a question arise how to identify the real problem 
                    correctly?</h2>
                <p>The most effective and efficient technique to identify the real problem 
                    correctly is to use 5 whys technique.</p>
                <p>This technique was discovered by the <b>Sakichi Toyoda</b>, the founder 
                    of Toyota Industries Corporation.</p>

                <h2>The 5 Whys Technique:</h2>
                <p>
                    The method is remarkably simple: when a problem occurs, you drill 
                    down to its root cause by asking "Why?" five times or until the root 
                    cause of problem is discovered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let’s have a look at an <i>example</i>:<br>
                    Problem: Ran through a red light.<br>
                    Why?: Late for work.<br>
                    Why?: Woke up late.<br>
                    Why?: Alarm clock broke.<br>
                    Why?: Didn’t check if it worked.<br>
                    Why?: Forgot to do it last night.<br>
                </p>
                <p>Watch the below video to understand clearly what the 5 Whys techinque is</p>

                <h2>But what next?</h2>
                <p>After identifying the root cause of the problem, we have to find an
                    effective and efficient solution.</p>
                <p>To solve the problem, there is a great technique called Reverse 
                    Brainstorming Technique.</p>
                
                <h2>Reverse Brainstorming Technique:</h2>
                <p>There are five steps to implement the Reverse Brainstorming technique which 
                    is as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Identify the problem</li>
                    <li>Reverse the problem</li>
                    <li>Collect ideas</li>
                    <li>Reverse the ideas</li>
                    <li>Evaluate the ideas and identify solutions</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Let’s take an <i>example</i> of Doctor’s office. The doctors want her to improve 
                    patient satisfaction with their visits. She prepares by writing down the 
                    problem statement:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>“How do we improve patient satisfaction?”</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Then she reverses problem statement:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>“How do we make patients more dissatisfied?”</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Next step is to collect the ideas to solve this reversed problem and here are 
                    some that she discovered:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Double book appointments</li>
                    <li>Remove the chairs from the waiting room</li>
                    <li>Put patients who phone on hold (and forget about them)</li>
                    <li>Have patients wait outside in the car park</li>
                    <li>Discuss patient's problems in public</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Then she reversed the ideas and discussed with her team. Well-resulting 
                    discussions are quite revealing. For example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Well of course we don't leave patients outside in the car park."</li>
                    <li>"But what about in the morning, there are often patients waiting outside 
                        until opening time?"</li>
                    <li>"Mmm, true. Pretty annoying for people on first appointments."</li>
                    <li>"So why don't we open the waiting room 10 minutes earlier so it doesn't 
                        happen."</li>
                    <li>"Right, we'll do that from tomorrow. There are several members of staff 
                        working already, so it's no problem."
                        </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The reverse brainstorming session revealed many improvement ideas that 
                    the team could implement swiftly.</p>
